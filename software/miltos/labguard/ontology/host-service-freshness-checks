How to perform "freshness" checking on results of host & service checks ?
Ensure that both checks are provided on a regular basis
Ensure that passive checks are being received as frequently as you want !

************************************
* How Does Freshness Checking Work *
************************************
(1) A freshness threshold for each host/ service
(2) For each host/ service the age of last check
(3) If age > threshold => check result is "stale"
(4) If check is "stale" => Nagios performs an active check

*******************************
* Enabling Freshness Checking *
*******************************
(1) Enable freshness checking ... CHECK_SERVICE_FRESHNESS, CHECK_HOST_FRESHNESS
(2) How Often ... SERVICE_FRESHNESS_CHECK_INTERVAL, HOST_FRESHNESS_CHECK_INT
(3) Enable host/ service freshness check ... CHECK_FRESHNESS = 1
(4) Thresholds ... FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD
(5) Actively check ... CHECK_COMMAND
(6) CHECK_PERIOD

* Example *
***********
Example of a service with freshness checking ... Nightly backup jobs
(External script that submits the results of backup job to Nagios Core once the backup is completed)
Results are provided by an external application 
Ensure backup jobs performed per day 

Active checks are disabled because ... the results of the service are made available by an external application

Freshness threshold is set to 26 hours ... backup jobs are late 

define service {
  host_name			backup-server
  service_description		ArcServe Backup Job
  active_checks_enabled		0
  passive_checks_enabled 	1
  check_freshness		1
  freshness_threshold		93600
  check_command			no-backup-report
}

define command {
  command_name		no-backup-report
  command_line		/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dummy 2 "CRITICAL:"
}

"check_dummy" Plugin

This plugin will simply return th state corresponding to the numeric value of <state> argument with optional text.
