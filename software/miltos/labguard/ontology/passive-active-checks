~~~~~~~~  PASSIVE Checks ~~~~~~~~~~~
------------------------------------

* Introduction

Use Nagios to monitor {hosts,services} ... regularly scheduled active checks

ACTIVE Checks => 
(1) Poll a device or service
(2) For status information
(3) Every X minutes

PASSIVE vs Active Checks => passive checks are performed by EXTERNAL appls
(1) Passives initiated and performed by EXTERNAL applications
(2) Passive check results are submitted to Nagios for processing  

* Use Cases
(1) Asynchronous Services => not effective polling on regular basis
(2) Monitoring services behind Enterprise firewall 

* How Passive Checks Work
(1) An external application checks the status of host/ service
(2) The External application writes results of check to file
(3) The next time Nagios reads the external command file will place results
(4) Nagios periodically execute a check result reaper and check the queue

<External Command File>

* Enabling Passive Checks
Set config-parameter: accept_passive_service_checks = 1

x Submitting Passive Service Check Results
(1) External-Command-File
(2) [<timestamp>] PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT;<host_name>;<svc_description>;..
    <return_code>;<plugin_output>
(3) <timestamp> is time in time_t format (seconds since UNIX epoch)
    <host_name> is short name of host associated with examined service
    <svc_description> is service-description as specified in service-definition
    <return_code> of check (0=OK, 1=WARNING, 2=CRITICAL, 3=UNKNOWN)
    <plugin_output> is text output of service-check

x Submitting Passive Host Check Results
(1) External Command File
(2) [<timestamp>] PROCESS_HOST_CHECK_RESULT;<host_name>;<host_status>;...
    <plugin_output>
