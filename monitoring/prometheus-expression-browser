Using the Expression-Browser
----------------------------
1) Start Prometheus with the configuration file you created
2) Give it a couple of seconds to collect data:
     => About itself from its own HTTP metrics endpoint
3) Navigate to built-in expression browser: 
     => http://localhost:9090/graph
4) Choose "Console" View & Enter a metric into 
     => "Expression" ... prometheus_target_interval_length_sec
     => Actual amount of time between target scrapes
     => Drop down list with availables to select
5) Returns a number of different time series
     => { interval = ... , quantile = ... }
6) If we are only interested in the 99th percentile latencies
     => prometheus_target_interval_length_seconds{quantile="0.99"}
5) Count the number of returned time series
     => count(prometheus_target_interval_length_seconds)

Using the Graphing Interface
----------------------------
1) Go to ... http://localhost:9090/graph
2) Use the ... "Graph" tab
3) Enter the expression to graph the ... per-second rate of chunks in self-scraped
     => rate(prometheus_tsdb_head_chunks_created_total[1m])
