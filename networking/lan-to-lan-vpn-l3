layer 3 connection -> bridge connection with IP routing

Network Bridge ... 
  is a "computer networking device"
  create a single AGGREGATE netrwork = multiple communication networks or segments

Bridging is !!!! DISTINCT !!!! from Routing ...
  
Routing is ...
  Selecting a path for traffic in a network
  or a path between multiple networks
   
  => Allows multiple networks to communicate independently 
  => But remain separate

In OSI model ...
  Bridging is "Data Layer/ 2"

Four(4) types of bridging ...
  1) Simple Bridging: a frame-by-frame decision whether to forward (two networks)
  2) Multiport: connects multiple networks (basis for switches)
  3) Transparent: uses a table called "forwarding information base"
  4) Source-route

Build a LAN-to-LAN VPN Using L3 IP Routing
------------------------------------------
Create a layer 3 connection ... between 2 or more remote networks .. using bridges

Build a LAN-to-LAN VPN Using L2 Bridge
======================================
Create a layer 2 connection ... between 2 or more remote networks .. using a bridge 

About Bridge-Connected LAN VPNs
-------------------------------
VPN-Server + VPN-Bridge = Layer 2 connection between an Ethernet LAN and Ithernet

Wide Area Ethernet = Extend an Ethernet segment

VPN-Server + VPN-Bridge = Broadband connection to Internet = SSL connection between LANs

Local Bridges 
Cascade Connections 

Virtual Hubs ...
  SoftEther VPN-Server can create Many Virtual Hubs

Creating Virtual Hubs
  Create & Delete by Entire VPN Server Administrator
  When created ... delegate administration into another party (by providing Virtual Hub administration pass)
  New Virtual Hub Details ... Name/ Admin-Pass/ 
  vpncmd -> HubCreate 

After Virtual Hub Create ... Select & Manage Virtual Hub
  vpncmd -> Hub
  Online/ Offline Status ... VPN Connection from Client to Hub is Possible/ Not Possible
  When the Virtual Hub = Cascade Connection Settings 

Cascade Connection Functions 
  Cascade Connections
    Site-to-Site VPN 
    A Virtual-Hub{ inside a }Virtual-Server --> connects to --> Other Virtual-Hubs on Other Computers
    Virtual Hubs are ... NOT originally connected are ISOLATED from the perspective of Layer 2 network
    Run two Virtual Hubs as a single segment over a public IP network (Internet) 
      Cascade connection is ... Connect Virtual Hubs with a very long Etehrnet cable

  Cascading a remotely located Virtual-Hub-A with Virtual-Hub-B: 
    Enables free layer-2 (Ethernet) communication:
      Virtual-Network-Adapter with Hub-A  
        A local bridge with {Network Computer with Hub-A}
      Virtual-Network-Adapter with Hub-B 
        A local bridge with {Network Computer with Hub-B}
      Local Computres {A & B} can communicate IRRESPECTIVE actual network topology
    VPN-Client is bridged to a Virtual-Hub 
        the Virtual-Hub is cascade connected to another Hub
          Arrived to destination computer
    Cascade Connection Initiator -> Internet -> {Many Hubs} -> Cascade Connection Responder

  At least two(2) Virtual Hubs: Initiating cascade VS Receiving cascade & Process
    Process = Common VPN Session 

Creatingh a Cascade VPN Connection 
 
 

Combining Bridge Connections and IP Routing 
-------------------------------------------
=> VPN-Server: Virtual Layer 3 Switching Capabilities
=> IP routing: Between multiple Virtual Hubs (under Same VPN-Server)
=> NICE because ... large scale LAN-to-VLAN where Each Individual LAN has multiple IP networks
