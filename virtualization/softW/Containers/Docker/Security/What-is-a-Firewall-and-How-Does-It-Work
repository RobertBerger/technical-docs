What Is a Firewall
------------------
Filtering Incoming and Outgoing Network Traffic

Eliminate All Unwanted Network Communication

STATEFUL Software Firewalls .... IPTABLES vs FirewallD

Amazon, Google ... Provide them 

TCP Network Packets
-------------------
Transport Control Protocol (TCP)

Move around a network as ... Packets { 
  Header[From, To, Sequence Number], 
  Payload

Headers are Important ... Deliver Correctly & Apply Security Rules

Successfully Receiving Incoming TCP Packets ... 
  The receiver sends Outgoing ACKnowledgment paxckets to sender

Types of Firewalls
------------------
1) Packet Filtering (Stateless) , 
   Inspect individual packets in isolation

2) Stateful ,
   Collect related packets .. able to analyze connection state

3) Application Layer ,
   Able to analyze transmitted data and apply firewall rules

Software + Hardware Firewall 

Firewall Rules 
--------------
Example #1: 
Rule A: Accept New and Established Incoming Traffic to Public Network Interface
        on port 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS web traffic)
Rule B: Drop Incoming Traffic from IP addresses of the non-technical employees
        in your office to port 22 (SSH)
Rule C: Accept New and Established Incoming Traffic from your office IP range 
        to private network interface port 22 (SSH)

Always : Accept/ Reject/ Drop (what action) 
         Allow traffic through/ Block the traffic but reply/ 
                         Block and no reply send

Default Policy
--------------
Problem ... A chain of firewall rules ... not explicitly cover every traffic

Use Default 

Icoming VS Outgoing Traffic
---------------------------
Incoming traffic to server ... originates elsewhere
Outgoing traffic ... the server sends

Outgoing important #1 ... always allow the server to send acknowledgments 
Outgoing important #2 ... downloading updates, database connection

Writing Outgoing Rules
----------------------
Outgoing Default Behavior ... Drop (Icoming Accept rules useless)

Rule A: Accept established outgoing traffic to public network on 80 and 443
Rule B: Accept establisehd outgoing traffic to private network on port 22

For DROP action .. No acknowledgement is needed

Firewall Software and Tools
---------------------------

[iptables]
A standard firewall in most Linux distros
Modern variant ... "nftables"
